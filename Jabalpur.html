        <h3>The city of Jabalpur - situated at the heart of Madhya Pradesh - is a very popular place amongst tourists. This city is surrounded by low hills and lies north of the River Narmada.</h3>
        <h3>Jabalpur is a city in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. On a rocky hilltop on the western outskirts of the city is the Madan Mahal Fort, built in 1116. Farther west, the centuries-old Pisanhari Ki Madiya Jain temple offers views of the city. Another Jain temple, Hanumantal Bada Jain Mandir, sits on the shore of a lake in the north. The central Rani Durgavati Museum displays intricately carved sculptures.</h3>
