        <h3>Mumbai is located in the state of Maharashtra. It is famously known as the capital of Maharashtra and the financial capital of India. Earlier it was known as Bombay. Its name is derived from the name of the goddess Mumba (a form of Parvati) who is the goddess of fishermen.</h3>
        <h3>Mumbai (formerly called Bombay) is a densely populated city on Indiaâ€™s west coast. A financial center, it's India's largest city. On the Mumbai Harbour waterfront stands the iconic Gateway of India stone arch, built by the British Raj in 1924. Offshore, nearby Elephanta Island holds ancient cave temples dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The city's also famous as the heart of the Bollywood film industry.</h3>
